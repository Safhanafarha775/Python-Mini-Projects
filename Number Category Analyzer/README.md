###📘 Number Category Analyzer###

A beginner-friendly Python mini project that analyzes any number and provides its characteristics such as odd/even, positive/negative, divisibility, range check, and a special bonus category.

🚀 Project Overview

This project takes any number as input and displays useful information about it:

#✔️ Features#

Detects Odd / Even
Identifies if the number is Positive, Negative, or Zero
Checks Divisibility by 5 and 10
Verifies if the number is between 1 and 100
Bonus: Prints “Special Number” if divisible by 6 or 9
Perfect for beginners learning conditions, modulus, comparisons, and logical operators in Python.

#🧠 How It Works#

The user enters any number.
The program processes the number and checks multiple conditions:
Whole number? → Then Odd/Even
Numerical sign → Positive/Negative/Zero
Divisibility → 5, 10
Range → 1 to 100
Bonus → Special Number (divisible by 6 or 9)
Results are printed clearly with labels.

#🧩 Sample Output
Enter any number: 45
